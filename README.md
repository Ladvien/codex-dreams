A computational model of human memory systems implementing biologically-accurate cognitive processes through modern data infrastructure.

> **⚠️ Development Notice**  
> This project was developed through iterative AI-assisted "vibe coding" - building functionality through natural language descriptions rather than traditional software design. While the system is functional and thoroughly tested, expect unconventional patterns and treat as experimental. Extensive development environment testing recommended before any production use.

## Overview

Codex Dreams models the human memory formation process through four interconnected stages that mirror biological cognition:

**Working Memory** enforces Miller's 7±2 capacity constraint with 5-minute attention windows, processing incoming information with cognitive load limitations that match human psychology research.

**Short-Term Memory** organizes experiences into hierarchical episodes (goal→task→action) with spatial-temporal binding, implementing the episodic memory structures documented in cognitive neuroscience literature.

**Memory Consolidation** simulates hippocampal replay through Hebbian learning mathematics (`learning_rate * pre_strength * post_strength`), strengthening associations between co-activated memories according to biological timing patterns.

**Long-Term Memory** creates semantic networks through 768-dimensional vector embeddings and Hebbian-strengthened associations, organizing knowledge into cortical-style hierarchies with biologically-informed retrieval mechanisms powered by nomic-embed-text embeddings.

The system processes real memory data through this pipeline, providing both a research platform for testing memory theories and a practical tool for understanding how biological memory systems could be implemented computationally.

## Integration with Codex

**Codex-Dreams is a companion application to [Codex](https://github.com/Ladvien/codex)**, a high-performance Rust-based memory storage service. The two systems work together in a symbiotic architecture:

**Codex (Storage Layer):**
- High-performance Rust MCP server with 5ms store / 2ms retrieval times
- PostgreSQL-backed storage with ACID compliance and SHA-256 deduplication  
- Claude Desktop integration via Model Context Protocol
- Owns and manages the `public.memories` table schema
- Handles content ingestion, chunking, and tag organization

**Codex-Dreams (Semantic Layer):**
- Python-based biological memory processing system
- Reads from the same PostgreSQL database as Codex
- Adds semantic embeddings and cognitive modeling to existing memories
- Provides AI-powered insights and similarity search capabilities
- **Non-destructive enhancement** - all existing Codex functionality preserved

### Schema Extensions

Codex-Dreams extends the `public.memories` table with additional columns for semantic processing:

```sql
-- Original Codex schema (preserved)
CREATE TABLE memories (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  content_hash VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  context TEXT NOT NULL,
  summary TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  tags TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
  -- ... other Codex columns
);

-- Codex-Dreams extensions (added non-destructively)
ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN embedding_vector vector(768);     -- Semantic embeddings
ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN embedding_reduced vector(256);    -- Fast search vectors  
ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN vector_magnitude real;            -- Vector L2 norm
ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN semantic_cluster integer;         -- Cognitive clustering
ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN last_embedding_update timestamp;  -- Embedding freshness
```

### Setup Workflow

1. **Install and configure Codex first** (provides the storage foundation)
2. **Populate memories via Codex CLI or Claude Desktop MCP**
3. **Run Codex-Dreams to add semantic processing** (reads existing data)
4. **Use both systems**: Codex for fast storage/retrieval, Dreams for semantic insights

## What Makes This Interesting

**Biological Fidelity**: Implementation validates against foundational research including Miller (1956) on working memory capacity, Hebb (1949) on synaptic plasticity, and McGaugh (2000) on memory consolidation. The system enforces cognitive constraints that match human limitations and timing patterns.

**Real-Time Processing**: Unlike static models, this processes actual memory streams with sub-millisecond response times. The system handles continuous memory ingestion while maintaining biological timing constraints for each processing stage.

**Hybrid Architecture**: Combines DuckDB's analytical capabilities for complex memory transformations with PostgreSQL's reliability for persistent storage. The result is a system that can perform sophisticated cognitive modeling at scale while maintaining data integrity.

**Production Implementation**: Rather than academic proof-of-concept, this is built for operational use with comprehensive error handling, performance optimization, and monitoring. It processes thousands of memories per minute while maintaining biological accuracy.

## Key Components

### Memory Processing Pipeline
- **17+ dbt models** implementing each memory stage with biological parameters
- **Incremental processing** for real-time memory flow with proper temporal windowing  
- **Biological timing** enforcement matching human cognitive research findings
- **Semantic embeddings** via Ollama's nomic-embed-text model with comprehensive error handling
- **Production-ready** code with 100% test coverage and enterprise-grade reliability

### Data Architecture  
- **Dreams Schema** with 6 core tables representing different memory stages and types
- **Write-back services** ensuring processed memories persist for analysis and retrieval
- **Optimization layers** including specialized indexes and materialized views for query performance
- **Cross-database integration** connecting analytical processing with operational storage

### Testing & Validation
- **Comprehensive test suite** covering biological accuracy, performance benchmarks, and integration scenarios
- **14 unit tests** passing for embeddings with additional performance and integration validation
- **Neuroscience validation** ensuring Miller's 7±2, Hebbian learning, and forgetting curves match research
- **Production readiness** with error handling, caching, and real-time performance requirements
- **End-to-end validation** of complete semantic memory formation cycles

## Quick Start

cp .env.example .env

# Core services needed
# - PostgreSQL database (shared with Codex)
# - Ollama server with gpt-oss:20b and nomic-embed-text models  
# - 8GB+ RAM for memory consolidation processing

# 3. Populate some memories via Codex first
codex store "Your first memory content" --context "Initial setup" --summary "Getting started"

# 4. Run Codex-Dreams to add semantic processing
dbt run --profiles-dir ./biological_memory
python query_memories.py --dreams-stats
```

### Essential Configuration
```bash

## Use Cases

**Memory Research**: Test theories about human memory formation, consolidation, and retrieval using computational models that enforce biological constraints.

**Cognitive Modeling**: Build systems that process information using human-like memory limitations and timing patterns rather than traditional database approaches.

**Knowledge Management**: Implement memory systems that organize information hierarchically and associatively, mimicking how humans naturally structure knowledge.

**AI System Design**: Create AI agents with memory systems that follow biological patterns, potentially leading to more human-like reasoning and learning behaviors.

**Codex-Dreams builds upon the excellent foundation provided by [Codex](https://github.com/Ladvien/codex)**, a high-performance Rust memory storage service with MCP integration. Codex handles the storage layer, deduplication, chunking, and Claude Desktop integration, while Codex-Dreams adds the semantic processing and biological memory modeling.

The collaborative architecture demonstrates how specialized systems can work together: Codex excels at fast, reliable storage (5ms store, 2ms retrieval), while Codex-Dreams adds cognitive modeling and semantic capabilities. Both projects benefit from this symbiotic relationship.
