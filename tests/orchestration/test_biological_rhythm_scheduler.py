"""
Unit tests for Biological Rhythm Pipeline Orchestration (STORY-011).

Tests the biologically-accurate memory consolidation timing based on:
- McGaugh (2000): Memory consolidation windows
- Diekelmann & Born (2010): Sleep-dependent memory consolidation
- Tononi & Cirelli (2006): Synaptic homeostasis during sleep
- Miller (1956): Working memory capacity limits

This test suite validates both the Python scheduler and Airflow DAG implementations.
