Hebbian Learning Biological Accuracy Tests - STORY-007

Validates that Hebbian learning calculations follow proper neuroscience research:
- Hebb (1949): "Neurons that fire together, wire together"
- Bliss & Lomo (1973): Long-term potentiation (LTP) discovery  
- Kandel & Hawkins (1992): Molecular basis of memory and LTP
- Bear & Abraham (1996): Metaplasticity and synaptic modification rules
- Song et al. (2000): Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanisms

Tests biological accuracy of:
1. Proper Hebbian formula: new_weight = old_weight + learning_rate * activity
2. Learning rate bounds (0.05-0.15 biologically realistic range)
3. Spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) temporal dynamics
4. Synaptic weight normalization to prevent runaway potentiation
5. Co-activation strengthening with temporal correlation
