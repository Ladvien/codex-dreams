"""
Integration tests for the complete biological memory pipeline.

This module tests the end-to-end integration of all memory processing stages:
- Raw memory ingestion
- Working memory filtering (Miller's 7±2)
- Short-term memory hierarchical processing
- Long-term memory consolidation
- Semantic network formation

Senior QA Review Notes:
- Tests realistic user workflows
- Validates data flows between components
- Ensures biological constraints are enforced
- Tests both success and failure paths
