"""
Comprehensive test suite for working memory implementation (BMP-004)

Tests biological memory working memory stage with:
- Miller's 7±2 capacity constraints
- 5-minute attention window
- Semantic extraction (entities, topics, sentiment, task_type)
- Phantom objects with affordances
- Importance-based ranking and priority scoring
- Performance benchmarks (<100ms execution time)
- Error handling and edge cases
