## Coordination Rules

1. **Claim Format**: `ðŸ”„ CLAIMED - [agent-name] - [timestamp]`
2. **Complete Format**: `âœ… COMPLETED - [agent-name] - [completion-timestamp]`
3. **Sync Frequency**: Every 1 minute during active work
4. **Conflict Resolution**: First to claim gets the story
5. **Self-Review**: Each agent must do self-review as different persona before marking complete
6. **Testing Requirement**: All code changes must include tests in `tests/` directory
