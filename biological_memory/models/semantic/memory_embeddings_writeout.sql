-- Memory Embeddings Write-Back to PostgreSQL
-- This model runs on PostgreSQL target and updates the memories table with pgvector data
-- Run this AFTER memory_embeddings has completed on DuckDB

{{ config(
    materialized='table',
    unique_key='memory_id'
) }}

-- Note: This approach requires manual coordination between DuckDB and PostgreSQL
-- For now, we'll create a staging table that can be populated via external process

SELECT
    gen_random_uuid() as memory_id,
    'placeholder' as content,
    NULL::vector(768) as embedding_vector,
    NULL::vector(256) as embedding_reduced,  
    NULL::real as vector_magnitude,
    NULL::integer as semantic_cluster,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP as last_embedding_update
WHERE FALSE  -- Creates schema but no data

-- TODO: Replace with actual data transfer mechanism
