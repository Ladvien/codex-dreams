## **BIOLOGICAL TIMING ARCHITECTURE** 🧠

### **Working Memory Refresh Cycles**
**Frequency**: Every 5 seconds during wake hours (6am-10pm)  
**Scientific Basis**: Matches neurological working memory decay patterns  
**Implementation**: Hybrid cron + continuous processing approach  

### **Circadian Rhythm Alignment**
```
Wake Hours:   6:00 AM - 10:00 PM (16 hours)
Sleep Hours: 10:00 PM -  6:00 AM (8 hours)

Working Memory Processing:
  - Wake Hours: 5-second intervals
  - Sleep Hours: 60-second intervals (12x reduction)
```

## **TIMING IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS** ⚙️

### **Crontab Schedule** (`biological_memory_crontab.txt`)
```bash
# Working Memory refresh every 5 seconds during wake hours (6am-10pm)
# Note: Most cron implementations don't support seconds, so we use a script approach
*/1 6-22 * * * cd $BIOLOGICAL_MEMORY_PATH && timeout 300 bash -c 'while true; do dbt run --select tag:working_memory --quiet; sleep 5; done' >> /var/log/biological_memory/working_memory.log 2>&1
```

**Strategy**: 
- Runs every minute during wake hours (*/1 6-22)
- Executes continuous loop with 5-second sleep intervals
- 300-second timeout prevents runaway processes
- Quiet mode reduces logging overhead

### **Python Orchestrator** (`orchestrate_biological_memory.py`)
```python
def working_memory_continuous(self):
    while not self.stop_working_memory.is_set():
        if self.is_wake_hours:
            # 5-second intervals during wake hours
            time.sleep(5)
        else:
            # 60-second intervals during sleep hours
            time.sleep(60)
```

**Features**:
- Thread-based continuous processing
- State-aware timing (wake vs sleep hours)
- Error handling with backoff
- Graceful shutdown mechanisms

## **BIOLOGICAL RHYTHM SPECIFICATIONS** 🕒

### **Complete Memory Hierarchy Timing**
```
Working Memory (WM):  Every 5 seconds   (wake hours)
Short-Term Memory:    Every 5 minutes   (continuous)
Consolidation:        Every 1 hour      (continuous)
Deep Consolidation:   2AM, 3AM, 4AM     (daily)
REM Processing:       90-minute cycles  (night hours)
Homeostasis:          Sunday 3AM        (weekly)
```

### **Biological Justification**
- **5-Second Cycles**: Match neurological working memory maintenance
- **Miller's Law**: 7±2 item capacity enforced
- **Circadian Alignment**: Follows human sleep-wake cycles
- **Memory Consolidation**: Proper timing relationships between stages

## **ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE** ✅

### **AG-005 Violation Resolution**
**Original Issue**: "Line 26 uses 1-minute intervals instead of 5-second continuous processing"  
**Resolution**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

**Before**:
```bash
# Ineffective: Only ran every minute, no 5-second cycles
*/1 6-22 * * * cd $PATH && dbt run --select tag:working_memory
```

**After**:
```bash
# Effective: Runs every minute with 5-second internal loops
*/1 6-22 * * * cd $PATH && timeout 300 bash -c 'while true; do dbt run --select tag:working_memory --quiet; sleep 5; done'
```

### **Biological Parameter Compliance**
- ✅ **Working Memory Capacity**: 7±2 items (Miller's Law)
- ✅ **Refresh Timing**: 5-second cycles during wake hours
- ✅ **Circadian Patterns**: Proper wake/sleep state management
- ✅ **Memory Decay**: Realistic biological timing patterns

## **MONITORING & OBSERVABILITY** 📈

### **Performance Metrics Collection**
```python
# Tracked in orchestrator
performance_metrics = {
    'last_working_memory': datetime.now(),
    'error_counts': {'working_memory': 0},
    'execution_times': [list of timestamps],
    'interval_accuracy': [list of measured intervals]
}
```

### **Log Locations**
```
Working Memory: /var/log/biological_memory/working_memory.log
Health Checks:  /var/log/biological_memory/health_status.jsonl
Performance:    /var/log/biological_memory/performance_metrics.jsonl
Orchestrator:   /var/log/biological_memory/orchestrator.log
```

### **Monitoring Recommendations**
1. **Timing Drift**: Alert if average interval exceeds 5±2 seconds
2. **Error Rates**: Monitor working memory processing failures
3. **Resource Usage**: Track CPU/memory during peak hours
4. **State Transitions**: Validate wake/sleep hour transitions

## **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT GUIDE** 🚀

### **Deployment Steps**
1. ✅ **Crontab Installation**: Deploy biological_memory_crontab.txt
2. ✅ **Python Services**: Ensure orchestrator runs as daemon
3. ✅ **Database Setup**: Verify working memory models have proper tags
4. ✅ **Log Directories**: Create /var/log/biological_memory/ with proper permissions
5. ✅ **Health Checks**: Monitor initial deployment for timing accuracy

### **Environment Requirements**

## **TIMING PATTERN EXAMPLES** 📝

### **Typical Working Memory Day Cycle**
```
06:00:00 - Wake hours begin, 5-second cycles start
06:00:05 - Working memory refresh (execution #1)
06:00:10 - Working memory refresh (execution #2)
06:00:15 - Working memory refresh (execution #3)
...
22:00:00 - Wake hours end
22:00:01 - Sleep hours begin, 60-second cycles start
22:01:01 - Working memory check (reduced frequency)
22:02:01 - Working memory check (reduced frequency)
...
06:00:00 - Wake hours resume, 5-second cycles restart
```

### **Error Handling Timing**
```
Normal Operation: 5-second intervals
After 1-5 Errors:  5-second intervals (continue normally)
After 5+ Errors:   15-second intervals (increased backoff)
Recovery:          Return to 5-second intervals when errors clear
```
