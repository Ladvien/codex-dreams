Comprehensive Test Suite for Memory Health Analytics - BMP-011

Tests biological memory health monitoring, analytics calculations, and alerting thresholds.
Validates memory distribution metrics, consolidation efficiency, and system performance indicators.

Test Categories:
- Memory distribution and age analysis
- Consolidation health metrics and efficiency
- Semantic diversity and cortical distribution
- System performance and capacity utilization
- Health status assessment and alerting
- Biological rhythm indicators and circadian phases
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
