**Recovery Rules Configuration:**
```python
'postgresql': RecoveryRule(
    failure_threshold=3,
    recovery_actions=[RESET_CONNECTIONS, RESTART_DATABASE],
    cooldown_seconds=120,
    max_attempts=3,
    escalation_actions=[ESCALATE_ALERT]
)
```

**Recovery Actions Implemented:**
- Service restart (Ollama)
- Connection reset (PostgreSQL, DuckDB)
- Cache clearing (LLM cache, temporary files)
- Log rotation for large files
- Memory cleanup with garbage collection
- Stuck process termination
- Alert escalation for manual intervention

### ✅ 5. Retry Mechanisms (Excellent)
**Files**: `error_handling.py`

**Enhanced Exponential Backoff:**
- ✅ Configurable backoff multiplier (default: 2.0)
- ✅ Jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
- ✅ Maximum delay caps to prevent excessive waits
- ✅ Comprehensive error logging for failed attempts
- ✅ Context preservation for debugging

**Production-Ready Features:**
```python
def exponential_backoff_retry(self,
                            func: Callable,
                            max_retries: int = 5,
                            base_delay: float = 1.0,
                            max_delay: float = 32.0,
                            jitter: bool = True,
                            backoff_multiplier: float = 2.0)
```

### ✅ 6. Integration and Orchestration (Very Good)
**Files**: `orchestrate_biological_memory.py`
